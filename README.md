Misere is a 4 player trick taking card game, where each player is dealt 5 cards each. They then taking it in turn to bet how many tricks the thing they can take, either outbidding the prevous bid, or passing, until
all players have passed. The betting priority is 2-3-Misere-4-Napoleon-Wellington. Napoleon and Wellington both represent a bet of 5, and Misere is a special bet where the bettor attempts to take 0 tricks.

Tricks are played in rounds, with the previous trick's winner (or the bettor on the first round) playing a card, and others MUST in turn follow suit. Trumps are decided by the first card played in the first trick
and if played in a trick where the lead suit was another suit, still win. Otherwise the player with the highest card (Aces high) wins.

After the betting phase has ended the game can be considered as a 3v1, where the players that didn't win the bet collaborate to defeat the bettor. 
The game is best played over multiple games of betting and playing, with the bettor either winning or losing points depending on how successful a bet was, making higher bets riskier
